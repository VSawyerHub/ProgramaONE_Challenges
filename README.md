# üìö Book Catalog API - Oracle ONE

This is the Book Catalog, a project developed as part of the challenge proposed in the `Java and Spring Framework T6 - ONE` training, which belongs to the Oracle ONE program curriculum.

## üí° Objective

The objective of this challenge was to provide a real-world development experience. Students were tasked with building a `REST API` that would serve as the `backend` for a book catalog application, implementing a complete `CRUD` functionality.

This project generates its own data through all the necessary `endpoints` to perform CRUD operations. It's worth mentioning that this API persists data in a `MySQL` database using the `Spring Data JPA` API from `Spring Boot`.

## üìå Dependencies

For the proper functioning of the Book Catalog, it's necessary to install the dependencies below. Click on the hyperlink for each one to go to the respective download page.
- [`MySQL`](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/): Database used by Book Catalog
- [`Maven`](https://maven.apache.org/install.html): Dependency manager used by Book Catalog

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Before running the project, we must configure some environment variables on our machine.

Below are the variables that should be created and the content each should contain:
| Variable | Content | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DB_BOOKCATALOG_API_HOST` | Database host. The address to access it along with the port | 127.0.0.1:3306 |
| `DB_BOOKCATALOG_API_DATABASE` | Specifies the name of the database that Book Catalog will use | book_catalog |
| `DB_BOOKCATALOG_API_USER` | Specifies the username to connect to the database | root |
| `DB_BOOKCATALOG_API_PASSWORD` | Specifies the password of the user defined in the previous variable | 10203040 |
| `JWT_BOOKCATALOG_API_SECRET` | Specifies the secret key used to sign and verify the authenticity of JWT tokens. It should be a random and secret number. | 91723847 |

## üöÄ Usage

There are two options to run the project:

### Option 1
Open the project with `IntelliJ IDEA` IDE and run the method below in the `BookCatalogApplication` class:

```java
public static void main(String[] args)
```

### Option 2
Enter the project folder through the terminal and run the command below:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
> [!NOTE]
> If you encounter problems with Maven when running Book Catalog, install version `3.9.5`, which was used in the construction of the project.

After running the program, send a request to the `/login` endpoint, providing email and password in a `JSON` format (these should be previously registered in the database in the `Users` table, with the password encrypted by BCrypt), to get the `JWT Token`.

Then, simply use the other endpoints normally to perform the desired actions, providing the JWT Token for authentication. It's worth mentioning that the JWT Token has a maximum duration of `two hours`, meaning a new JWT Token needs to be obtained every two hours.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings
1. This project was built and tested on JDK 17, so we recommend using it when executing the project.

## üåê Repository Structure
This project is part of a larger repository divided into three branches:
- ONE branch: Contains this Book Catalog project developed with Spring
- [Other branches contain different challenges from the Oracle ONE Program]
