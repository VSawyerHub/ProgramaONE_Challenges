# üí± Currency Converter API - Oracle ONE

This is the Currency Converter API, a project developed as part of the challenge proposed in the `Java and Spring Framework T6 - ONE` training, which belongs to the Oracle ONE program curriculum.

## üí° Objective

The goal of this challenge was to provide a real-world development experience. Students were tasked with building a `REST API` using Spring Framework that functions as a currency converter, allowing users to convert between different currencies using real-time exchange rates.

Unlike previous projects in the Oracle ONE program that consumed external APIs, this project not only connects to external currency exchange APIs but also implements a complete `CRUD` system for managing conversion history and user preferences.

## üìù End Points

### üü¢ Swagger

The API endpoints are documented with Swagger. To access this documentation, run the project and go to:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/
```

### üê∂ Bruno

In addition to Swagger, in the root folder of the project there is a folder called 'endpoints', which contains all the endpoints used to test the API.

To use these files, install [`Bruno`](https://www.usebruno.com/) and import the collection of endpoints (mentioned folder above) by clicking the `Open Collection` button, which can be found by clicking on the three dots on the left side of the screen.

## üìå Dependencies

For the proper functioning of the Currency Converter API, it is necessary to install the dependencies below. Click on the hyperlink for each one to go to the respective download page.
- [`MySQL`](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/): Database used by the Currency Converter API
- [`Maven`](https://maven.apache.org/install.html): Dependency manager used by the Currency Converter API

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Before running the project, we need to configure some environment variables on our machine.

Below are listed the variables that should be created and the content that each one should contain:
| Variable | Content | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DB_CURRENCY_API_HOST` | Database host. The address to access it along with the port | 127.0.0.1:3306 |
| `DB_CURRENCY_API_DATABASE` | The name of the database that the Currency Converter will use | currency_converter |
| `DB_CURRENCY_API_USER` | The username to connect to the database | root |
| `DB_CURRENCY_API_PASSWORD` | The password of the user defined in the previous variable | 10,203,040 |
| `EXCHANGE_API_KEY` | Your API key for accessing the exchange rate service | abc123def456 |
| `JWT_CURRENCY_API_SECRET` | The secret key used to sign and verify the authenticity of JWT tokens. Should be a random and secret number. | 91723847 |

## üöÄ Usage

To run the project, we have two options:

### 1st Option
Open the project with `IntelliJ IDEA` IDE and run the method below in the `CurrencyConverterApplication` class:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(CurrencyConverterApplication.class, args);
}
```

### 2nd Option
Navigate to the project folder in your terminal and execute the command below:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
> [!NOTE]
> If you encounter problems with Maven when running the Currency Converter, install version `3.9.5`, which was used in the project construction.

After running the program, send a request to the `/login` endpoint, providing email and password in a `JSON` (these must be previously registered in the database in the `Users` table, with the password encrypted by BCrypt), to get the `JWT Token`.

Then, you can use the other endpoints normally to perform the desired actions, providing the JWT Token for authentication. It's worth mentioning that the JWT Token has a maximum duration of `two hours`, so every two hours it is necessary to get a new JWT Token.

## üîÑ Features

- Real-time currency conversion
- Historical exchange rates
- Conversion history tracking
- User preference management
- Secure authentication with JWT

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

1. This project was built and tested using JDK 17, so we recommend using it when running the application.
2. Remember to set all environment variables before running the application.
3. To use the currency conversion functionality, you will need a valid API key from a currency exchange rate provider.

## üåê Project Structure

The project follows a standard Spring Boot application structure:
- `src/main/java`: Java source code
- `src/main/resources`: Configuration files and static resources
