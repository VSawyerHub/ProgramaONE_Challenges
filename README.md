# üí± Currency Converter API - Oracle ONE

This is the Currency Converter API, a project developed as part of the challenge proposed in the `Java and Spring Framework T6 - ONE` training, which belongs to the Oracle ONE program curriculum.

## üí° Objective

The objective of this challenge was to provide a real-world development experience. Students were tasked with building a `REST API` using Spring Framework that functions as a currency converter, allowing users to convert between different currencies using real-time exchange rates.

Unlike previous projects in the Oracle ONE program that consumed external APIs, this project not only connects to external currency exchange APIs but also implements a complete `CRUD` system for managing conversion history and user preferences.

## üìå Dependencies

For the proper functioning of the Currency Converter API, it is necessary to install the dependencies below. Click on the hyperlink for each one to go to the respective download page.
- [`MySQL`](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/): Database used by the Currency Converter API
- [`Maven`](https://maven.apache.org/install.html): Dependency manager used by the Currency Converter API

## üöÄ Usage

To run the project, we have two options:

### 1st Option
Open the project with `IntelliJ IDEA` IDE and run the method below in the `CurrencyConverterApplication` class:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(CurrencyConverterApplication.class, args);
}
```

### 2nd Option
Navigate to the project folder in your terminal and execute the command below:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
> [!NOTE]
> If you encounter problems with Maven when running the Currency Converter, install version `3.9.5`, which was used in the project construction.

After running the program, send a request to the `/login` endpoint, providing email and password in a `JSON` (these must be previously registered in the database in the `Users` table, with the password encrypted by BCrypt), to get the `JWT Token`.

Then, you can use the other endpoints normally to perform the desired actions, providing the JWT Token for authentication. It's worth mentioning that the JWT Token has a maximum duration of `two hours`, so every two hours it is necessary to obtain a new JWT Token.

## üîÑ Features

- Real-time currency conversion
- Historical exchange rates
- Conversion history tracking
- User preference management
- Secure authentication with JWT

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

1. This project was built and tested using JDK 17, so we recommend using it when running the application.
2. Remember to set all environment variables before running the application.
3. To use the currency conversion functionality, you will need a valid API key from a currency exchange rate provider.

## üåê Project Structure

The project follows a standard Spring Boot application structure:
- `src/main/java`: Java source code
- `src/main/resources`: Configuration files and static resources
- `src/test`: Test classes

## üë®‚Äçüíª Technologies Used

- Java 17
- Spring Boot
